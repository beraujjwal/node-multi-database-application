## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beraujjwal/node-multi-database-application.git
   ```
### Using manual download ZIP

1.  Download repository
2.  Uncompress to your desired directory

### Install npm dependencies after download (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd node-multi-database-application
npm install
npm update
   ```

### Setting up environments

1.  You will find a file named `.env.dist` on root directory of project.
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.dist .env
    ```
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment. Helpful comments added to `.env.dist` file to understand the constants.

Replace the values with your specific configuration. Don't worry, this file is in the `.gitignore` so it won't get pushed to github.

## How to run

1. Running the app locally

   Run this command, which is located in npm script in `package.json` file.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
